# DevNetwork

A MERN social networking app for devs!

## Motivation

This is an app built with MongoDB, Express.js, React.js/Redux and Node.js
The purpose of the app is to have a fully functional social network that will, throughout the building of the app, help solidify knowledge of the tools at work.

## Build status

Just the beginning! I will spend the first part of this project building the API.

<!-- ## Code style

## Tech/framework used

<b>Built with</b>
Mongo, Express, React/Redux, Node, Git/Heroku

## Features

User authentication with web tokens and using redux to manage the app are some of the new technologies I will be learning in this app.

<!-- ## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise. -->

<!-- ## Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running. -->

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Contribute

Let people know how they can contribute into your project. A [contributing guideline](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) will be a big plus.
